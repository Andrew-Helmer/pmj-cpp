These python files were generated using the analyze_error tool. The error_analysis.py file contains the data used to generate the convergence plot in the main README.md. The pmj02_balance_analysis compares the convergence of PMJ(0,2) sequences with random subquadrant selection, vs. ox-plowing, vs. the sub-sequence stratification.

Sorry there isn't yet any documentation on how to use these files. I'm working on an example Colab notebook.
